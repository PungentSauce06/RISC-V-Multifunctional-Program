# RISC-V-Multifunctional-Program
A menu-driven RISC-V assembly program implementing a calculator, Fibonacci series generator, and a simple quiz game.
# Multifunctional RISC-V Assembly Program

This project is a menu-driven program written in RISC-V Assembly that demonstrates multiple functionalities within a single executable:

- Basic Calculator – perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- Fibonacci Sequence Generator – compute and display the first `n` terms  
- Quiz Game – multiple-choice questions with scoring

## Features

- Menu-driven interface: easy navigation between features
- Arithmetic operations: implemented directly in assembly
- Iterative algorithms: for example, Fibonacci sequence generation
- Interactive logic: quiz mode with score tracking
- Returns to the menu after each operation until exit


## Tech Stack

- RISC-V Assembly
- RARS (RISC-V Assembler and Runtime Simulator) – chosen for its simplicity, educational focus, and ease of debugging.
The repository includes the exact `RARS.jar` file used, so you can run the program directly.


## Repository Contents

| File | Description |

| `RARS.jar` | RISC-V simulator executable used to build and run the program |


## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Launch the RARS simulator:
   ```
   java -jar RARS.jar
   ```
